## TP 4 Notes

- In exercise 1 we learned how to apply textures to a shape based on the vertices and the relative positions of the wanted textures in a texture map.
. 
- This exercise was pretty easy, but understanding that the (0,0) position for the texture is top left, not bottom left, took some tinkering to acknowledge.

- In exercise 2 we learned how to apply different textures to different shapes in the same file, as well as how to change the filtering method for lower resolution textures, which end up being stretched by default.

- Discovering the correct places and commands to activate the filtering effect proved to be slightly difficult.
