## TP 2 Notes

- In exercise 1,  we learned how to utilize matrices, and some WebCGF integrated functions, to alter shapes through scalation, translation and rotation. We also learned how the order of these transformations affects the final result, being that these are done around the origin.

- In this exercise, we also learned how to use multiple shapes to create a composite shape, which can then be called with its own sigular "display()" method, and further transformed.

- In this exercise, we had some difficulty figuring out how to create the class and functions for the composite shape.

- Below, is the requested tangram next to our implementation.

- In exercise 2, we learned how to create a three-dimensional figure by defining every one of its vertices.

- We also learned how to combine the previously defined tangram with the cube and apply transformations to the set.

- Below, is the tangram and cube combined.

- In exercise 3, we learned how to create a three-dimensional figure by combining multiple two-dimensional shapes.

- It was possible to observe that replacing the cube with the new one results in the same set.

- Below, is the set with the new cube.
