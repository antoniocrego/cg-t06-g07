## TP 3 Notes


- In exercise 2, we learned to find patterns in defining shapes, such as in the index list and the vertex positions, and utilized them to make an infinitely scalable prism shape through loops.

- Also in exercise 2, we learned how to calculate the normals needed for Constant Shading, which are the normals for each individual polygon that consitutes the overall shape, causing the same shading per polygon, which ends up being a very "flat" and "edgy" type of shading.

- In this exercise, we had difficulties obtaining the actually expected shading, as despite having the correct normals, the shading was still very smooth, possibly due to the indexes.

- In exercise 3, we learned how to apply Gouraud Shading and to simplify index/vertex lists.

- This exercise was relatively simple, and was executed without much difficulty, but the fact it had similar results to the shading in exercise 2 was odd, however, this is probably due to some problem in exercise 2, not 3.
